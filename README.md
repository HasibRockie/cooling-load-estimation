# Cooling Load Estimation for a Room in Southern Bangladesh (April, 5 PM)
This repository provides a set of tools and resources to estimate the cooling load for a room located in the southern region of Bangladesh. The estimation is focused on the specific conditions of April, particularly at 5 PM when temperatures tend to rise due to solar radiation. Accurate cooling load estimation is crucial for designing efficient HVAC systems and maintaining comfortable indoor environments.

## Contents
- `data` : For calculation, necessary HVAC data tables are included.

- `CAD Model` : Solidworks model for the room.  

- `Images` : 2D and 3D views are added as images.  

- `Calculation Document` : Cooling load calculation documentation in both \LaTeX and PDF format. 


## Methodology
The cooling load estimation is based on a combination of factors including room dimensions, building materials, solar radiation, outdoor temperature, and heat-generating sources. Our methodology employs established equations and algorithms widely used in the field of building energy analysis.
